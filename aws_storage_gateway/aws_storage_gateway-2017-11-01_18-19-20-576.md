aws storage gateway appliance available for download 
4 types of storage gateways

file gateway nfs
    word files 
    pdf 
    videos pictures 
volume gateway iscsi
    database
    not stored on s3 
        stored volumes 
        cached volumes 
tape gateway  (VTL)

start with easiest gateway 
    file gateway 
        NFS 
        mount point 
            storing in s3 

    direct connect 
    through vpc also 
        sending information to s3 

moving on to volume gateway 
    disk volumes 
        iscsi 
    applications 
    databases 
    virtual harddisk 
point in time snapshots 
EBS snapshots 
    volume gateway 
  snapshots are incrmental   

2 diff types of volume gateways 
    virtual harddisks on prem 
    back them up 

    stored volumes 
        asyc back up to aws 
        taking snapshots of EBS 
        moving them s3 

    cached vouems let you use s3 as primary data storage 

    designed unstore volumes 

    gateway 
        cached volumes 
        all data goes to s3 

here is our cached storage 
    there is an upload buffer 
    virtual disks sit inside s3 
    cant have blocked based storage on s3 

    some kind of ebs storage 
    everytime write data its storaged in s3 

    a bit complicated 

hang in there 

volume tape gateway 
    used for back up 
    virtual tape based back up 
    on taped gateway 
    net back up 
    backup exec exec
    Veeam

virtual tapes backed by s3

   virtual tapes uploaded to s3  

all sounds complicated 
    storage or back up background 

ec2 section of the course and watch this section again
