query an edge location
	if not there then it will be cached from the origin

there is a ttl
	time to live

that the resource will stay on the edge location

the origin server does not have to be aws

understand what a web distribution
typically used for websites

rtmp distribution for streaming
adobe

origin is the origin of the file

origin does not have to be with aws

distribution is a series of edge location
	web distributions most common
	rtmp media streaming distribution



can write new files to edge locations as well
not for read only

	put back up to the origin server

	replicated to the origin

cached for the life of the ttl

if you have an object

you can clear the cache but there will be a charge

have questions?

let me know otherwise create first cloud front distribution
