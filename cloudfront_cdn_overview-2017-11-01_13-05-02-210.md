cloud front is a content delivery network 

what does that actually mean? 

take the world map running a website out of the UK 

access the webpage making a request to the server in the UK

undersea cables create greater latency not just a direct straight line 

access a webpage or a movie file 

what is an edge location?

location where content will be cached 
    all around the world 
    may not be a region but an edge location 

what is an origin 
    origin of all files where the CDN will distribute
