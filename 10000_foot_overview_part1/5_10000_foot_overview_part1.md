    not hours of services not quized on 
these are all the services 

aws global infrastrucutre is a new one

does seem to be a lot here

these services

messaging services
desktop and app streaming
    workspaces
security identity definitely

management tools only a little bit
all of the below bread and butter
storage databases
netowrk and content delivery compute
aws global infrastructure

start with aws global infrastructure
physical stuff that aws runs on
break it down into 3 different areas 
	14 regions 
    38 avail zones
    65 or greater edge locations
	place in a world
		aws service exists
never quized
    on how many there are
    always new regions coming
    africa
    indonesian

14 regions and 38 az

4 more regions and 11 more az zones in 2017

prediction for 2017

what is a region? geograpical area
	2 or more AZ in a region

AZ is multiple data center
    logical data center

close to each other but not dependent on each other 

how many AZ in each region

AZ is a data center but can be a collection of datacenter

2 or more AZ
	in a particular region

move onto edge location 
	content delivery netwwork
    endpoint for cloud front

cover it off in networking section of the course
    large media objects

video files pictures
new york to austrailia downloading
caching at edge location on the second time of access

more edge locations than regions
66 edge locations around the world

add edge locations

look at regions
	north america 5 different regions one of the largest
    most customers in the US
	different edge location networks
        ashburn virgina atlanta

start looking then choose region closer to you
    some don't have lambda service in a particular region

South America
    1 region
    
Europe and middle east and africa
    2 regions

    UK region coming online

	different edge locations around europe
