delete everything that we have created

if you get stuck then go back to the videos

this is the difference between passing and failing

public and private subnets
nat instances and nat gateways

bastion host

sssh into that and then ssh into other private ec2 instances

have done the solutions architect exam and pass then you can pass developer and sysop associate exam

for developer dynamo
for sysops know cloud watch!

then you can do the other 2

you've learned 60% of the content already and you can learn the other stuff quickly

add onto that

focus on specific areas

good to pass all 3 associate exams

terminate all these instances

terminate and hit yes

these instances are live
so they create a dependency cant delete the vpc without deleting the instances

some peopel forget

same with load balancers
have to delete ec2's

takes a while to delete vpcs

interestingly can't delete nat gateway in time

go into nat gateway
takes a little too long
once it's deleted go back and delete vpc

can delete this time?
if not wait 5 min and come back and do it again

have been doing things manually

can go back to vpc dashbard and create public and private subnet
don't do that yet for the purpose of learning

build own vpc from memory

public private 
subnets
nat instance and gateway

bastion server

then you are prepared for the exam as possibly you can be
