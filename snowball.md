before there was snowball there was import/export disk 

portable storage devices for transport 
    500gig 
    1tb 
with a slow internet connection 
external hard disk from amazon 
bypass the internet 

became a nightmare to manage 
there are 3 diff types 
    standard snowball
        quite big and heavy  
        few weeks ago 
        peta scale data transer solution 
        streamline bringing data in 
        bypass the internet 
    edge 
        looks like snowball 
        contain a 100TB of data 
        come with compute capability
        a data center bring it on premise 
        move in and out 
        run lambda functions of them 
        airline manufactures
            deploy snowballs onto airplanes and collect data 
            ship the snowball edge to aws 
            upload the data 
        aws data center in a box
    snowmobile
        massive datacenter on a truck 
        petabyte or exabyte
        snowmobile 
        100 petabyte / snomobile
        order 10 of these is an exabyte 
        reinvent presentation 
        video library 
        complete datacenter migration 
            transfering is secure faster and cost effective 
they come with kindles
perform software erasure of the snowball
