s3 101
------------------------------
what it is
have lots of lab 
use s3 regularly

solution and developer
fundamental understanding 
s3 has been around for a long time

object storage 
amazon s3 
store and retrieve any type of data 
store files on the cloud

founder of drop box
------------------------------

found it troublesome
webpage that interacted with s3
store data on s3 

dropbox leverages s3 for storage
leverages the backbone of s3

object based or block based 
------------------------------

object is a video or photo or pdf 
these are flat files
    not an operating system or a 
    database 
        these are block based storage 

multiple devices and facilities
    designed against failure

fantastic and cheap
    store all files on s3 

up in s3 cool applications cloud berry labs
    gives windows explorer environment but stored on s3 

look into a normal windows but you are in s3 

store files 
no OS or db
    size
        files 0 bytes
        or 5TB

unlimited storage 
files stored in buckets

folders 
universal name space must be unique globally
test_bucket
    someone else owns the bucket or that name 

create the bucket and creates the dns address
always s3-region.amazonaws.com/username

s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru

understand the format of bucket names
recieve http 200 code
    upload is successful 

data consistency model for s3 

read the docs 
------------------------------
really dry sometimes 
learning online can be easier 

read after write consistency for puts of new objects
    read immediately after puts of a new object
    
eventual consistency for overwrites,  puts and deletes
    propogation if you update an existing object
    takes time to propagate for constiency across all facitlities
    either get new version or old version and not partial
        that is an atomic transaction

s3 is a key value store
    what do we mean by that?
    key name of the object
    value is the data
    version id
    metadata
        simply data about data
        (date that you uploaded)
        last time of update

(this was a duplicate explaination)
s3 object based consists of the following
    what are we creating?
objects consist of the following
    key ( simply the name)
        sort in alphabetical order
        lexagraphical 
            design considerations 
        scenarios for different exams
        date and a time
        what will happen data will be physically stored in the same place then there is performance bottleneck
    add some filename salt
       filenames that are very similar then consider add some randomness 
    value 
    version id (important for versioning)
        which version of the object is this?
    meta data
        data about data
    subresources
        exist underneath an object
        access control lists what they sound like 
            who can access this object 
                allow fined grained permissions
                individual buckets 
                individual files
    
    have Torrent
        supporting bittotrent protocol

what else should you know?
    service level agreement
    built for 99.99% availability for s3 platform 
    99.99% guaarantee
    99. 11 9s durability guarantee
        wont lose a file how durable is the data

    comes with tiered storage options

    lifecycle management 
    30 days old then sits here 
    after then move
    90 days data archival
        glacier 

    service level agreement
        sla


    versioning supported 
        multiple different versions 
    
    encryption on s3 several different ways
    secure in a couple of diff ways acccess different ways
        access control list 
        bucket policies

    there is normal s3 

        multiple devices and multi facility
        designed to sustain loss of 2 facility concurrently
        highly available

    s3 IA infrequent access
        still require rapid access though
            when accessed
            want to review immediately
        payroll 
        charged retrieval fee
        costs you much lower fee

    rrs 
        reduced redundancy  storage
        same availability but durability drops
            99.99% 
            not 11 9s
        can still generate the data 
            but it is a pain

        rrs for thumbnails 
        save some money on storage

    glacier 
        very cheap but for data archival only
        takes 3 -5  hours to restore from glacier

a few hours or days  all these different scenarios then pick the best place to store data on s3

sum up of different options on s3 

    standard 
    s3 IA 
        durability same 
    rrs
    
    glacier
        come back glacier is its own service
        its own icon 
        for data archival 

    s3 vs glacier
    
    availability sla
         takes you a few hours for first byte latency

compare glacier with simple storage tiers 
take hours for first byte latency 

know a hell of a lot except s3 charges
what are the charges on s3?
    charge for storage 
    requests
    storage management pricing
        control costs 
        track costs against s3

charge for 
    storage how much data
    number of requests 
    storage management pricing
        add tags to control costs 
        track costs against s3
    data transfer pricing 
        data coming in to s3 is free 
        moving data aroudn will cost you 
    transfer acceleration
        what is it?
        s3 enables fast easy and secure
        globally distrib edge locations 
        routed over optimal network path
    
        bucket location is in london
        uploading to edge locations are much closer to the user

           accellerate the upload speed of files 
    
        amazon s3 transfer acceleration

37% faster if turned on 

exam tips 
------------------------------
object based
    word files vidoes pictures
0 - 5 tb 
unlimited storage 
files are stored in buckets
s3 buckets are unique globally

link to s3 bucket 
s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucketname

read after write consistency for puts of new object
eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes
    (some time to propagate)

normal s3 durable available
s3 ia durable immed avail but good for infrequent access 
s3 rrs 
    easily reproducible

glacier
    archival

remember s3 object 
    key 
    value 
    version 
    metadata
    subresources
        ACL
        bit torrent protocol

object store only 
successful uploat HTTP 200 status code response
