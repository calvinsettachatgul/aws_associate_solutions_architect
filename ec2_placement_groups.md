ec2 placmement groups
------------------------------

logical grouping of instances in a single az

low latency between ec2 

10gb/sec
cant span multi az

certain types
not t2 micro 

homogenous instances 


hadoop cluster 
casandra nodes 
very low latency high throughput 

cant span multiple az
    min network latency 

always in one az 
compute optimized gpu mem optimized storage optimized 

recommend homogenous instance families groups sizes 

cant move existing instance into placement groups
