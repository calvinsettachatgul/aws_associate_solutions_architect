developer exam?

dynamodb most important thing to know!

go and show you and do some theory
then create a dynamo db table

fast flexible nosql

low latency
supports doc
and key value

mobile web gaming ad-tech iot and many other applications

working on a project

learn a lot more in a hands on way in that course

also in developer associate course

few facts

ssd
3 datacenters geographically destinct data centers

3 different facilities
do have redundancy built in do have consistentcy models

eventually
strongly 
consistently reads

reached within 1 second

should return the updated data

strongly consistent reads

reflects all writes that have recieved a successful response

wait for a second?

then eventual consistent

provisioned throughput capacity

write throughput
and read throughput

hourly fee for every 10 units

hourly fee same for every 50 units

charged on storage costs

how many writes and reads needed

dynamo db cahrged write and read per second


thing to remember for pricing example?

point out to you

can be expensive for writes but inexpensive for reads

lots of reads but little writes

scaleable and needs performance

look at dynamodb instead of rds

how to set up dynamodb table

create table

add in primary key!
student id?

change to a number studentid
leave eerythigng else to default settting

change read and write capacity 

go ahead and hit create

it is quick see what it is doing

creating table

now see it has already created that

now have the table and have different things

reserved capacity for dynamodb

have to enter into 1 or 3 year contract

don't know anything about my table yet

go back to dashboard and go to tables

click on items
items are basically a row in the table

click append

it will be a string
create a field first name
add first name

hit save

it will create a table student id and first name

first row 101 and first name ryan

create a second row student id is 102
add a string same naaming convention
string will be elizabeth

add a second field
insert or append

insert will be above


firstName 
surname: Jones

but because naming convention same with fristname

good with dynamo will create fields automatically

add different columns


bring up students with a surname string jones

want to get rid of that?


that is it for creating and adding records

keymetrics?
read capacity and write capacity

provisioned vs consumed

only paying for what consuming

every week 

then update the capacity

on the fly its really easy to scale and this is pushbutton scaling

going in and updating

compared with rds
then create snapshot or read replica


then ami change the size

wont have any down time

push button scaling
rds it is harder to scale and you will have some downtime!

explore in developer course

also in depth in devops professional course 

xcode and swift

store some variables and information

using the dynamo app

move on to next lecture
