last lecture
its on lambda

so advanced will replace ec2

move workloads from ec2 to lambda

cloud guru is hosted on lambda

what is lambda?
upload code and create a lambda function


lambda will take care of the rest

event driven compute service

runs code in response to events

upload photo to s3
triggers and s3

lambda triggers and changes photo to a thumbnail

event driven compute service

in response to http request

api gateway make api calls using aws sdks

interacting with lambda on cloud guru

read .acloudguru blog

how do they use lambda and it is serverless
angularjs running across devices

communicate through aws api gateway and to lambda

lambda responding to devices

transcoding video uploads

data centers
hardware racks

assembly code/ protocols
high level languages

operating systems

application layer/ aws apis

ontop of that you have lambda

don't have to worrry about the lambda stack!

what are the languages available?
node.js
java
python

how is it priced?

2 different ways

first 1million requests free 
$.20 per 1million requests
thereafter

duration also 
calculated from begin to returns or terminates

lambda is so fantastic

a cloud guru is so cheap!!
costs are very very low!

only paying for execution time!

easier than running and ec2 farm

no servers
no patching maintaining

no security worries

continuously scales!!!

no autoscaling groups

lambda auto scales to meet demand

its super cheap

rather than worrying about ec2 instances

reinvent 2014

need to understand what it is!!!

in this stage its not in there yet


also give me an idea of the questions if you see it

a cloud guru has  a course about lambda

check out the lambda course

any questions? no then move on!
