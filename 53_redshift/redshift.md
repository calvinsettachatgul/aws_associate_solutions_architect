fast powerful fully managed datawarehouse 
analytics processing 
digital radio product that is being sold 
figure out the net profit 
figure out the number of radios 
    in each zone 
unit cost

digital radio product 

calculate the net profit 

adding up columns 
    bringing all the data together 

looking at a column 
    transaction successful?

adding up columns concept 
this is looking at a common column 
not all the fields of a record 
with redshift 

single node 
160 Gb of data 

multinode 
leader node 
    receives queries 
compute node 
    up to 128 compute nodes

can be a huge multinational
multi node 
manages client connection 
then communicates to compute nodes 
columnar data storage 
organizing data by columns 

columnar is good for analytics 
only columns are processed and stored sequentially 
column queries 

does not use data
