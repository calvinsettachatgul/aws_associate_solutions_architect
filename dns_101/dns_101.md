    resolves to elastic load balancers and then to ec2s
    elb never have an ip address 
    only have a dns name 
    cant use an a record to an elb

    use an alias record 

next import thing 
    ttl record 
    time dns record cached on resolving server or users local pc

dns request 

important to think of this from architectural point of view 
    most ttl set for 2 days  

running out of ipv4 addresses

moving from azure to aws 
before the migration drop the ttl down to 5min 
wait 2 days before migration 

dns to old site or to the new site 
advise to plan in advance lower the ttl to 200 sec
do the migration 2 days later 

will only be affected for 5 min window

playing with dns 
    naked domain name can only be 
    zone apex record 

need ipv4 
    cant get for elb 
    ipv4 could change all the time  

alias record auto maps naked domain name to elb

alias records 
    save you time 
    aws auto recog changes 

example.com 
    to elb 
    lb-1234.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

this is an easy way to map naked domain name to elb
