------------------------------

using application called stress 
start randomly terminating things 
ec2 getting stressed 
failing
rds failing as well 

break something that you've built 

launch config and autoscaling group 

looked at the discussion forums 
Enter your Write URL under "WordPress Address (URL)" and your Prod URL under "Site Address (URL)".

how can we break this?
load testing run stress on the ec2 
by ssh
