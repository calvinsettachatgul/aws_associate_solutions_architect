theoretical

what is a placement
what scenarios

logical grouping of instance within availavility zones

low latency 10gb networks
low latentcy
high newtwork throughput

cassandra
hadoop

communicate between each other

very low netwrok latency
high throughput

10gb per second

can't span multi availability zones

only single point of failure

can't spread across multi AZ

don't want latency reduced to nothing

always in one AZ

name must be unique in account


only certain types

Compute optimized
GPU 
mem optimized
storage optimized

homogenous instances in placedment groups
same size and family

not a mixture from diff families
in same placement group
around reservations

remember can't merge
cant move existing instance into placement groups

can creat ami from existing then launch instance from ami into placement group though
