efs lab 

need to understand efs 
elastic file system 
amazon elastic compute cloud 
storage capacity is elastic 

applications have the storage they need when they need it 

provision the ebs volume 
then mount to a particular instance 

mount volume to 2 ec2 instance at once 
supporst the nfsv4 protocol 

elastic file system
theoretical view 
file storage for ec2 

   nfsv4  
only pay for storage that you use 
just put files on it and 30cents per gig 
up to petabyte 
1000s of concurrent requests at once 
its quite new 
    not 11 9s durability 
    will get a durability rating 

efs is block based storage 
    files and share them with other ec2 instances 

s3 
    read after write consistency 
    block based not object based
