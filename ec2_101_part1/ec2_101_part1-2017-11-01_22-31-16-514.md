ec2 101 part 1
------------------------------
what is ec2
    virtual machines in the cloud 
    the different types 
    what you had to do before?
    changing the economics of computing 

how many processors 
cores 
ram 
disk size 
tier storage 
ssd or magnetic 
entire specification 

how long to purchase or rent?
12 mo or 24 mo period 
or 5 years 
finance?

rack the server 
the cabling and internet 
sysadmins 
right OS 
company security 
weeks to 12 mo 

cloud computing 
instant provision 
web portal 

start experimenting 

did not need huge budgets 

changed all of IT 

pay by the hour 

on demand 
-----
    by second for linux
reserved 
-----
    discount on hourly charge  
    capacity reservation 
    offer discount 

spot 
-----
    bid whatever price you want 
        how much you are willing to pay 
    greater savings 
    flexible start and end times 
    spot rate moves all the time 
dedicated hosts 
-----
    physical ec2 
        dedicated to you 
    licensing 
    use your software license 
    dont want multitenant scenario 

on demand 
-----
    low cost and flexibiltiy 
    app with short term or spiky unpredicatble work load 
reserved 
-----
    low cost and flexibiltiy 
    app have a steady state or predicatable usage 
    require reserved capacity 
    upgront payment to reduce total computing costs even farther 

    standard reserve instance 
    convertible ri spend the same or more change the status cant spend less 
    scheduled ri launch within the time window you reserve 
spot 
-----
    low cost and flexibiltiy 
    flexible start and end time 
    very low compute prices 
    
    case studies 
    insurance or genomic 
    3am in the morning 
        not using spot prices then several millions of dollars as opposed to 8000 

urgent compute needs 
dedicated hosts 
-----
pricing models 
different families 

d2 dense storage 

r for ram 
    memory optimized 

m general purpose 
    main choice 
    application servers 

c compute optimized 

g graphics intensive 

i highspeed storage 

f field programable gate arrays 
    change the hardware to suite the software 
    fpga
    hardware acceleration 

t low cost gen purpose 
    t2 micro 
    web server 
    database server 

p2 graphics gen purpose gpu 

x1 memory optimized 
    sap hana apache spark 
    extreme memory 
    extreme ram 


when there were 7 of them

    what the letters stand for 
    d density 
    r ram 
    m main choice gen purpose apps 
    c compute 
    g graphics 
    i iops 
    f fpga
    t chap gen purpose compute t2 micro 
    p graphics pics 
    x extreme memory

where are you going to see this in the 8 exams 

choose the best instance type 

chooose which one are valid 

make an informed choice
