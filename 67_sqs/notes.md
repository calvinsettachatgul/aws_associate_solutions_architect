sqs was the first service longer than ec2

need to know what sqs is read the faq section prior to the aws exam

this entire lecture is theoretical

this can be quite wordy

webservice to access message queue

to store messages while webserver is waiting to proces them

alert an upload of an image so that a job can be done and queued

application service may access the image
and apply a task

example applying a water mark

then update the queue and 

loosely coupling the environmnet

example application servier lost while watermark then other application servers can do that task

distributed queue system

reliably queue to be consumed by another service

queue is a temp repository

any can store messages in a fail safe queue

comes up time and time again

256k big

retrive the messages programmatically using the sqs api
